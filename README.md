Cache-friendly associative container with an Eytzinger layout for C++11/14/17


## About
`fixed_eytzinger_map` is a free implementation of Eytzingerâ€™s layout, in a form of an STL-like generic associative container, broadly compatible with a well-established access patterns.

An Eytzinger map, or BFS(breadth-first search) map, places elements in a lookup order, which leads to a better memory locality. In practice, such container can outperform searching in sorted arrays, like `boost::flat_map`, due to less cache misses made in a lookup process. In comparison with RB-based trees, like `std::map`, lookup in Eytzinger map can be multiple times faster. Some comparison graphs are [given here](https://kazakov.life/2017/03/06/cache-friendly-associative-container/).

Unlike std- or boost- associative containers, `fixed_eytzinger_map` can't be modified after initial construction. This limitation comes from it's layout principle and an inability to alter it with any bearable complexity. It's content can be assigned or swapped in a transaction-like manner, but no per-key alterations are allowed.

`fixed_eytzinger_map` supports heterogeneous lookup, either with `std::less<>` or using a custom comparator with an `is_transparent` tag.

## How to use it
`fixed_eytzinger_map` comes in a form of a single header with no dependencies. This implementation is platform- and architecture agnostic. Just drop `fixed_eytzinger_map/include/fixed_eytzinger_map.h` to some reachable place and include this header:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <numeric>
#include <fixed_eytzinger_map.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
   fixed_eytzinger_map<int, string> m{{
      {0, "Hello"}, {1, ","}, {2, " "}, {3, "World"}, {4, "!"}, {5, "\n"} }};

   for( int i = 0; i <= 5; ++i )
      cout << m[i];

   cout << "strlen = " << accumulate(begin(m), end(m), 0, [](int s, const auto &i){
      return s + i.second.size(); }) << endl;

   cout << "keys order: " << accumulate(begin(m), end(m), ""s, [](string s, const auto &i){
      return s + to_string(i.first) + " "; }) << endl;
}
```
Output:
```
Hello, World!
strlen = 14
keys order: 3 1 5 0 2 4 
```
